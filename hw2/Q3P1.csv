API,Method,URI,Description
Public,POST,https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json,"Allows the user to post a status.
Returns a lot of information about the post such as its user's data for displaying profile pictures and who that user is for other things like mouse overs.
Returns data about how many retweets and such the post has, though as the post is brand new these values are likely always 0.
It has contains data about what hashtags are in the tweet, I'm not sure how this data is expected to be used.
 Will deny duplicate requests with the same content:
{
  ""errors"": [
    {
      ""code"": 187,
      ""message"": ""Status is a duplicate.""
    }
  ]
}"
Public,POST,https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/destroy/:id.json,"Allows the user to delete a status they own. 
Returns the same data as update's initial creation. Essentially you get back what you put in on delete. Probably makes un-delete application level functionality easy.
When trying to delete another user's post it sends back:
  ""errors"": [
    {
      ""code"": 183,
      ""message"": ""You may not delete another user's status.""
    }"
