API,Method,URI,Description
Public,POST,https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json,"Allows the user to post a status.
Returns a lot of information about the post such as its user's data for displaying profile pictures and who that user is for other things like mouse overs.
Returns data about how many retweets and such the post has, though as the post is brand new these values are likely always 0.
It has contains data about what hashtags are in the tweet, I'm not sure how this data is expected to be used.
 Will deny duplicate requests with the same content:
{
  ""errors"": [
    {
      ""code"": 187,
      ""message"": ""Status is a duplicate.""
    }
  ]
}"
Public,POST,https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/destroy/:id.json,"Allows the user to delete a status they own. 
Returns the same data as update's initial creation. Essentially you get back what you put in on delete. Probably makes un-delete application level functionality easy.
When trying to delete another user's post it sends back:
  ""errors"": [
    {
      ""code"": 183,
      ""message"": ""You may not delete another user's status.""
    }"
Public,POST,https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/retweet/693912311094976517.json,"Retweets the tweet whose id you supply.  Returns the original tweet with all the details (original poster, etc.) of the original tweet."

Public,POST,https://api.twitter.com/1.1/favorites/create.json?id=702976364660572161,"Before November 2015, the like action was known as favorite, so the API name still has the historic ""favorites"" name, although the new option is ""like"". It is an asynchronous process that lets create a like on a tweet. If the process is successful (200 OK response), it returns a ""liked"" status for the status' ID given as parameter of the authenticating user. Note: if try to favorite/like a tweet twice, the request will throw an error (from Postman). {
  ""errors"": [
    {
      ""code"": 139,
      ""message"": ""You have already favorited this status.""
    }
  ]
}"
Public,GET,https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json,"The request returns a collection of the most recent tweets posted by the user (indicated by the screen_name or user_id parameters of the request).
The timeline can only be requested if the authenticated user owns the timeline or is a follower of the user's timeline.
The request can only return up to 3,200 recent user tweets in the timeline. "
